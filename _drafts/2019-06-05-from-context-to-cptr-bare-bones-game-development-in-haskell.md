title: 'The Spirit of Play: Ride Along Game Development in Haskell'

I got into programming when I was 8 because I wanted to make games. I guess, deep down, I was never truly able to satiate that desire. I've never released a game, I've never completed a game, and hell -- I've never gotten far enough to even draw up assets for a game.

But I ran into a library yesterday called Raylib that kind of rekindled the playful fire that lived deep down under my pragmaticism. Raylib lives at [https://www.raylib.com/](https://www.raylib.com/). I immediately fired up VS Code and hammered out some C for the first time in two or three years. Suffice to say, I had _fun_. Not fun like "wow, this code is elegant," or fun like "wow I'm making a lot of money doing this," but fun like "I'm giggling at the screen because I made a circle bounce back and forth."

And that was an incredible feeling.

So, in the spirit of all things good: if it's worth doing, it's worth overdoing. That's why I'm writing this blog post. 

This won't be like any other blog post that I've written. I am writing this post live as I'm experimenting with building a game from the bottom up in Haskell. You'll see every single decision I make, and everything I find exciting enough to share, even if I go back on it five minutes later. No game frameworks, no library bindings -- just me, Stack, a fresh install of [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/), and a readiness to get hacking. 

In one window, I have my blog post. In the other window, my code. Without further ado...

## 9:23 PM

I came up with the idea and started writing this blog post.

## 11:19 PM

Finally got around to initializing the stack project!
