A big topic in the study of ecology is the idea of biodiversity. Like everyone learned in middle school, it's the idea that an ecosystem needs a lot of different species to be healthy.

Programming languages also make up a sort-of ecosystem. Languages get born, they wax and wane, and they die out. Programming languages have "parents" (languages that they've taken features from) and "children" (languages that took features from them).

In my opinion, the programming language ecosystem is dying. There's such an overarching lack of diversity that the good ideas become drowned out by the popular ideas and paradigms.

Let's take a look at the StackOverflow 2018 survey from <https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2018/>.

Here are the most popular programming languages from the "Most Popular Technologies" section of the survey (with all the non-language technologies pruned out):

* JavaScript: 69.8%
* Java: 45.3%
* Python: 38.8%
* C#: 34.4%
* PHP: 30.7%
* C++: 25.4%
* C: 23.0%
* TypeScript: 17.4%
* Ruby: 10.1%
* Swift: 8.1%
* Go: 7.1%
* Objective-C: 7.0%
* VB.NET: 6.7%
* R: 6.1%
* Matlab: 5.8%
* VBA: 4.9%
* Kotlin: 4.5%
* Scala: 4.4%
* Groovy: 4.3%
* Perl: 4.2%

I'd like to point out a few things. The first one is that there is only one primarily functional languages in that list. There are many languages that treat functions as first class residents, like Python, C++, and Ruby. Scala is the only language there that places functional programming on the forefront. The overwhelming majority of languages there (JavaScript, Python, PHP, TypeScript, Ruby, Objective-C, VB.NET, R, VBA, and Perl) are imperative dynamic languages.
