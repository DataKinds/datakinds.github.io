It's been a while since [I've talked about the discord](/2018/08/31/programming-language-theory-discord) on the blog. That changes right now. I've spent the last few days overhauling the place, adding a starboard, role reactions, and so much more. I think that it now has the possibility to become a truly bumpin' place. Join, and let me know how the fancy new Community Server Welcome Screen (tm) treats you.
