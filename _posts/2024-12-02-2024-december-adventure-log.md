Hello all! I will be participating in the 2024 [December Adventure](https://eli.li/december-adventure), and this is my captain's log for the month. From Eli's page:

> The [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is cool, but a lot, and not everyoneâ€™s jam.
> The December Adventure is low key. The goal is to write a little bit of code every day in December.
> ## How?
> Pick a project, or projects and work on them a little bit every day in December.

# Day 2 (12/2/24)

Got this page set up and did a little brainstorming for what I want to work on this month. I know that there are two things off the top of my head I wanted to hammer out:

* I wanted to get an 88x31 badge set up for my website, along with a little area to display others' 88x31s. [yui](https://zptr.cc/) asked me last month and I still have not bothered...
* I want to work more on [Rosin](https://github.com/DataKinds/tree-rewriter) -- specifically, fleshing out the pattern variables to allow any variable to specify its eagerness, and adding syntax for rewriting a global state on top of the s-expr rewrite pointer. Something like

```
(; $comment) ~> 

(; (This rewrite has no state attached))
hello ~> world

(; (This rewrite only runs if there's a `ready` in the global bag))
hello |ready|~|done| world

(; (So we need new syntax for "lambda rules", rules which only run once. We use a backslash in place of the tilde.))
(; (Here's a "lambda rule" which adds a `ready` to the bag. The following rules are equivalent.))
\|ready|
||\|ready|
```

DAY 2 UPDATE 1: I ended up finishing a pretty good majority of the refactor that was required to flesh out pattern variables in Rosin! Check out the big ol' git diff [here](https://github.com/DataKinds/tree-rewriter/pull/1/files).

# Day 3 (12/3/2024)

I may or may not have stayed up past my bedtime working on Rosin... I'm passing all my regression tests on the new pattern variable branch!! Now we can swap eagerness on and off on all variables, even special accumulators. Tomorrow (today, after a sleep) I should write some more regression tests, for the pack/unpack accumulators and for the universal eagerness switch. 

On the left, some of my regression tests. On the right, my passing test dashboard!

UPDATE 1: it's 10:18pm, I just finished up a minor redesign of my site. Hopefully this color scheme is easier to read, and the header is no longer the size of the screen + it's no longer begging for your attention. The mobile version of the site was also improved, so it should no longer be impossibly narrow on narrow screens. Let me know how it works!!

Update 2: Merged in my pattern variable refactor in Rosin and that simplified things nicely. I also [split apart the regression tests to make them stop sharing state](https://github.com/DataKinds/tree-rewriter/tree/main/sample/regression) and updated the readme to reflect the new syntax.

# Day 4 

You know, I really don't have to put the dates on the headings of each of these entries.

Today I worked a bit more on souping up the tests in Rosin. I made tests be [printed to standard out](https://github.com/DataKinds/tree-rewriter/commit/7a8da5a748d455e11f78e04ef16417323614cfdf#diff-0a88c502e6b2fded6c22871f555f64a0da4a9fc0213e4b7b067f15f51f2780be) instead of requiring the compiler to output the final state. I also separated all the [test files into multiple different files](https://github.com/DataKinds/tree-rewriter/tree/main/sample/regression) so they run in their own contexts.

All of this makes running tests quite nice. The Makefile lets me run specific sets of tests too.

![Makefile running just one set of tests](/assets/imgs/december-adventure/4-tests1.png)
![Makefile running all my tests](/assets/imgs/december-adventure/4-tests2.png)

I also fixed some (but not all) bugs with the accumulators I uncovered while writing extra tests. For example, the Pack and Unpack accumulators don't work quite how I want them to. They don't quite walk the s-expression fully and it's quite buggy.

```
((pack ?@) ~> ?@)
(pack (this (is a (strangely) nested) list)) 
 --- became --- 
(this is a) 
```

I'll have to deal with that soon. For something I fixed... turns out if you matched multiple values against the negate accumulator, they'd all come back backwards.

```
((negate ?- ?- ?-) ~> ?-)
(negate 1 2 3) 
 --- became ---
(-3 -2 -1)
```

That's fixed now. Progress!

# Day 5

Didn't do a lot of coding today. Between moving, work, and having a house guest over tonight I simply wasn't sitting at the computer for very long. 

I got about an hour to myself. I started thinking a bit about setting up a runtime state abstraction in Rosin. This will let me add a multiset bag, support one time lambda rules, and set up a better more explicit ordering for how rules are ingested and then applied.

My changes are still very preliminary, [I posted them up onto a separate branch](https://github.com/DataKinds/tree-rewriter/pull/2/files). 

For background entertainment, I was watching this today:

# Day 9

Whew. I am sorry for the lack of updates, but the last couple of days flew by. On the 6th and the 7th, my partner and I were going back and forth to the house we're moving into. On the 7th and 8th our power was out. To be more specific: the power was out in exactly half of our unit -- and my computer's outlet was unfortunately affected. All the while I have work and other shenanigans that get in the way. Le sigh... we cringe on...

I worked on Rosin a little bit tonight. I fixed a bug in the new [tree zipper](https://wiki.haskell.org/Zipper) datatype [where moving the zipper down to the first child](https://github.com/DataKinds/tree-rewriter/blob/main/src/Zipper.hs#L81-L90) would [reverse the right hand side of the context](https://github.com/DataKinds/tree-rewriter/commit/9aebbc03a45af3b47bc615feac96be6e9368a0ca#diff-37b5a1b9dce90ec661a8a9b74adc0b64c58e8c2c62b9717cbcacefff2b45074eL51). I suppose it made sense at the time but hindsight is 50-50 and I cursed my past self. So the zipper works correctly now which is pretty cool. It worked well enough [so I merged the zipper into main :3](https://github.com/DataKinds/tree-rewriter/commit/5285ea99ed5b5acc8dbd584e12eef09563c3d0f0)

I have been listening to a lot of Remi Wolf.

# Day 10

Rosin progresses little by little. You can now define single use rules with `~`, like so:

```
$ rosin -p
(/evil/ ~ "$<good$>") "the evil wizard" "the evil tower"


+-----------------+
| Final transform |
+-----------------+
"the good wizard"
"the evil tower"
```

So that will definitely allow for some fun stuff. 

I want to start writing more interesting programs in Rosin, but I keep going down development rabbitholes. The final rabbithole is nearing its conclusion: I have hashed out how I want multiset state rules to look. You will be able to interact with the multiset bag on the rewrite head with the `(:needs | :gives)` pattern. The same function that matched `~>` rules WILL SOON know how to match all variations of these `|` rules... [but it's not quite there yet](https://github.com/DataKinds/tree-rewriter/blob/main/src/Runtime.hs#L105).

```        
$ rosin-can't-do-this-quite-yet -p

(|(apple pear orange peach)) puts an apple, pear, orange, and peach into the bag
(apple |) takes an apple out of the bag
(apple |) doesn't match a second time 

+-----------------+
| Final transform |
+-----------------+
puts an apple, pear, orange, and peach into the bag
takes an apple out of the bag
(apple |) doesn't match a second time
```

Both sides do not need to be specified. `|` indicates a multiset matching rule that will only run once, and `|>` rules will run ad infinitum.

```
( (pear apple grape peach) |> ((fruit salad)) )
now the combination of pear, apple, grape, and peach will always become (fruit salad)
```

Wait, I heard you say: `(fruit salad)`? Like, you put an S-expression into the multiset? Heck yeah I did! [The full range of Rosin values can go into the multiset](https://github.com/DataKinds/tree-rewriter/blob/main/src/Runtime.hs#L45) and this means we'll be able to hijack the pattern variable machinery to do some very cute things:

```
( (sword (stone :name)) | ((sword :name)) )

( | (stone "King's stone"))
( | sword)
will produce one thing in the bag: (sword "King's stone")
a sword's strength is derived from its legendary name
```

Last but not least -- you'll be able to devise a rule that only matches the S-expression tree when something is in the multiset bag. Or a tree rewrite rule that adds something into the bag. The `&` symbol will be able to combine a multiset rewriting rule with a tree rewriting rule, such that the combined rule only matches when both conditions are satisfied. This has some crazy potential imo, and I just nailed down the syntax tonight:

```
(| n & hello ~> world) 
produces an n to the bag every time it matches `hello`

(n n | m & (; :comment) ~>) 
limits the amount of comments you can write to half the `hello`s you write... better be polite!
```

Some of this is implemented, some of it isn't... but I feel good having this all theorycrafted and the way forward from here seems clear to me.

# Day 11

Only posting a quick update today because I want to head to sleep early!!

A few new Rosin updates for ya....

I added a new regression test for the multiset state:

```
(Test a "Plain terms can be parsed and consumed"
    Given (
        ((pomme pomegranate) |> weird-fruit-salad)
        (|pomme)
        (|pomegranate)
        (|(pomme pomegranate))
        (weird-fruit-salad|)
        (weird-fruit-salad |)
    )
    We expect ())
```

I finished setting up [the consumption of rules with multiset action](https://github.com/DataKinds/tree-rewriter/blob/main/src/Runtime.hs#L135), see `recognizeDef`. So Rosin will now really recognize and consume all these forms of rules:

```
(pattern ~> template) a tree rewriting rule
(pattern ~ template) a one time tree rewriting rule
((things i want) |> (things i will get)) a multiset rewriting rule
((things i want) | (things i will get)) a one time multiset rewriting rule
(want | get & pattern ~ template) a one time combined tree+multiset rewriting rule
(want | get & pattern ~> template) a combined tree+multiset rewriting rule
```

Note that the shortened forms from the regression test (like `(weird-fruit-salad |)`) won't currently work.

Very soon Rosin will be able to apply tree rewrite rules conditionally based on the state of the multiset, [but for now I left a hole in the function](https://github.com/DataKinds/tree-rewriter/blob/main/src/Runtime.hs#L180) where it will be filled with dedicated `Multiset` methods. Soon. I'm so close to having this working.

```hs
-- Filters a list of defs down to only those which are satisfied by the current state of the multiset
filterByMultiset :: Monad m => [EatenDef] -> RuntimeTV m [EatenDef]
filterByMultiset defs = do
    pocket <- gets runtimeMultiset 
    pure $ filter (ok pocket) defs
    where ok ms = undefined
```

For anyone still reading, thanks for sticking with me on this journey. I have really been looking forward to writing these entries every night. 

# Day 15

I spent the day today on the phone with banks and electricians making preparations for the new house. A few days ago my partner and I hosted a packing party. All of our friends came over, ate pizza, and put our belongings into boxes. Progress on my blog or projects has taken a bit of a backseat to moving.

All that being said, I worked on Rosin a bit more tonight!

There is a full fledged `Multiset` type now. All I've got implemented is reading things out of the multiset but putting things in will come soon enough. 

```hs
module Multiset where
import qualified Data.Map as M
import Control.Monad (foldM)


newtype Ord a => Multiset a = Multiset { unmultiset :: M.Map a Int } deriving (Show)

fromList :: Ord a => [(a, Int)] -> Multiset a
fromList = Multiset . M.fromList

toList :: Ord a => Multiset a -> [(a, Int)] 
toList = M.toList . unmultiset

empty :: Ord a => Multiset a
empty = Multiset M.empty

null :: Ord a => Multiset a -> Bool
null = M.null . unmultiset

-- Is this element inside the multiset in a sufficient quantity? 
inside :: Ord a => (a, Int) -> Multiset a -> Bool
inside (x, n) = maybe False (n <=) . M.lookup x . unmultiset 

-- Are these elements inside the multiset in a sufficient quantity? 
allInside :: Ord a => Multiset a -> Multiset a -> Bool
allInside xns ms = all (`inside` ms) (toList xns)

-- Take out this many copies of this element from our multiset, if we can!
grab :: Ord a => (a, Int) -> Multiset a -> Maybe (Multiset a)
grab xn@(x,n) ms = if inside xn ms then Just . Multiset . M.adjust (subtract n) x . unmultiset $ ms else Nothing

-- Take out this many copies of these elements from our multiset, if we can!
grabMany :: Ord a => Multiset a -> Multiset a -> Maybe (Multiset a)
grabMany xns ms = Multiset <$> foldM (\m xn -> unmultiset <$> grab xn (Multiset m)) ms' xns'
    where ms' = unmultiset ms; xns' = toList xns
```

The Rosin runtime now checks that the multiset is satisfactory for any given function before using it to rewrite. Check out that sick ass runtime:

```hs
-- Filters a list of defs down to only those which are satisfied by the current state of the multiset
filterByMultiset :: Monad m => [EatenDef] -> RuntimeTV m [EatenDef]
filterByMultiset defs = do
    pocket <- gets runtimeMultiset 
    pure $ filter (ok pocket) defs
    where 
        ok :: MS.Multiset (Tree RValue) -> EatenDef -> Bool
        ok ms def = MS.allInside (defWantsFromBag def) ms

-- Carry out one step of Rosin's execution. This essentially carries out the following:
--   1) We check for a definition at the current rewrite head and ingest it if there's one there
--   2) We try to apply our rewrite rules at the current rewrite head
--   3) We move onto the next element in the tree in DFS order. If we're at the end, we loop back to the start
-- Gives back (the amount of rules applied, whether we jumped back to the top of the tree). 
runStep :: RuntimeTV IO (Int, Bool)
runStep = do
    verbose <- gets runtimeVerbose
    -- Begin 1
    eatDef 
    -- Begin 2
    -- Apply single use tree rewriting rules
    -- !!! ===== We check the multiset here!!! Take a look....  ===== !!! --
    defs <- gets runtimeSingleUseRules >>= filterByMultiset
    maybeTreeRewrite <- applyTreeDefs defs
    when (isJust maybeTreeRewrite) $ do -- A single use rule matched once, we gotta delete it!
        let (Rewrite patternToDelete _) = fromJust maybeTreeRewrite
        modifyRuntimeSingleUseRules (filter (patternDefEq patternToDelete))
    -- Apply multi use tree rewriting rules
    -- !!! ===== We check the multiset here again!!! Wow!!!!!  ===== !!! --
    defs' <- gets runtimeRules >>= filterByMultiset
    maybeTreeRewrite' <- applyTreeDefs defs'
    -- Begin 3 (I Love Laziness)
    newZipper <- gets (Z.nextDfs . runtimeZipper)
    modifyRuntimeZipper (const newZipper)
    when verbose (lift $ print newZipper)
    -- Give back the value we use to assess termination
    atTop <- gets ((== []) . Z._Ups . runtimeZipper)
    pure (sum $ maybe 0 (const 1) <$> [maybeTreeRewrite, maybeTreeRewrite'], atTop)
        where
            -- True if the EatenDef has the same pattern as the tree
            patternDefEq :: Tree RValue -> EatenDef -> Bool
            patternDefEq pat1 def = case defToRewrite def of
                Nothing -> True
                Just (Rewrite pat2 _) -> pat1 /= pat2 
```

Sorry. Maybe it's rude to throw a huge block of code at you at once. I ought to be more polite.

Anyways, Rosin will now refuse to match a rule if the multiset state is insufficient. Look!

```
$ cat sample/small.tree; rosin -p sample/small.tree 
(fruit-salad | () & hello ~> world)
(1 2 3 hello 4 5 6)

+-----------------+
| Final transform |
+-----------------+
(defined "Multiset {unmultiset = fromList [(fruit-salad,1)]}| & hello ~> world")
(1 2 3 hello 4 5 6)
```

So that's that. Hope you enjoyed! Next time maybe we'll go less heavy on the Haskell and heavier on the Rosin. Talk to you soon!
