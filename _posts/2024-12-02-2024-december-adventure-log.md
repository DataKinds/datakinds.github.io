Hello all! I will be participating in the 2024 [December Adventure](https://eli.li/december-adventure), and this is my captain's log for the month. From Eli's page:

> The [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is cool, but a lot, and not everyoneâ€™s jam.
> The December Adventure is low key. The goal is to write a little bit of code every day in December.
> ## How?
> Pick a project, or projects and work on them a little bit every day in December.

# Day 2 (12/2/24)

Got this page set up and did a little brainstorming for what I want to work on this month. I know that there are two things off the top of my head I wanted to hammer out:

* I wanted to get an 88x31 badge set up for my website, along with a little area to display others' 88x31s. [yui](https://zptr.cc/) asked me last month and I still have not bothered...
* I want to work more on [Rosin](https://github.com/DataKinds/tree-rewriter) -- specifically, fleshing out the pattern variables to allow any variable to specify its eagerness, and adding syntax for rewriting a global state on top of the s-expr rewrite pointer. Something like

```
(; $comment) ~> 

(; (This rewrite has no state attached))
hello ~> world

(; (This rewrite only runs if there's a `ready` in the global bag))
hello |ready|~|done| world

(; (So we need new syntax for "lambda rules", rules which only run once. We use a backslash in place of the tilde.))
(; (Here's a "lambda rule" which adds a `ready` to the bag. The following rules are equivalent.))
\|ready|
||\|ready|
```

DAY 2 UPDATE 1: I ended up finishing a pretty good majority of the refactor that was required to flesh out pattern variables in Rosin! Check out the big ol' git diff [here](https://github.com/DataKinds/tree-rewriter/pull/1/files).

# Day 3 (12/3/2024)

I may or may not have stayed up past my bedtime working on Rosin... I'm passing all my regression tests on the new pattern variable branch!! Now we can swap eagerness on and off on all variables, even special accumulators. Tomorrow (today, after a sleep) I should write some more regression tests, for the pack/unpack accumulators and for the universal eagerness switch. 

On the left, some of my regression tests. On the right, my passing test dashboard!

UPDATE 1: it's 10:18pm, I just finished up a minor redesign of my site. Hopefully this color scheme is easier to read, and the header is no longer the size of the screen + it's no longer begging for your attention. The mobile version of the site was also improved, so it should no longer be impossibly narrow on narrow screens. Let me know how it works!!

Update 2: Merged in my pattern variable refactor in Rosin and that simplified things nicely. I also [split apart the regression tests to make them stop sharing state](https://github.com/DataKinds/tree-rewriter/tree/main/sample/regression) and updated the readme to reflect the new syntax.

# Day 4 

You know, I really don't have to put the dates on the headings of each of these entries.

Today I worked a bit more on souping up the tests in Rosin. I made tests be [printed to standard out](https://github.com/DataKinds/tree-rewriter/commit/7a8da5a748d455e11f78e04ef16417323614cfdf#diff-0a88c502e6b2fded6c22871f555f64a0da4a9fc0213e4b7b067f15f51f2780be) instead of requiring the compiler to output the final state. I also separated all the [test files into multiple different files](https://github.com/DataKinds/tree-rewriter/tree/main/sample/regression) so they run in their own contexts.

All of this makes running tests quite nice. The Makefile lets me run specific sets of tests too.

![Makefile running just one set of tests](/assets/imgs/december-adventure/4-tests1.png)
![Makefile running all my tests](/assets/imgs/december-adventure/4-tests2.png)

I also fixed some (but not all) bugs with the accumulators I uncovered while writing extra tests. For example, the Pack and Unpack accumulators don't work quite how I want them to. They don't quite walk the s-expression fully and it's quite buggy.

```
((pack ?@) ~> ?@)
(pack (this (is a (strangely) nested) list)) 
 --- became --- 
(this is a) 
```

I'll have to deal with that soon. For something I fixed... turns out if you matched multiple values against the negate accumulator, they'd all come back backwards.

```
((negate ?- ?- ?-) ~> ?-)
(negate 1 2 3) 
 --- became ---
(-3 -2 -1)
```

That's fixed now. Progress!

# Day 5

Didn't do a lot of coding today. Between moving, work, and having a house guest over tonight I simply wasn't sitting at the computer for very long. 

I got about an hour to myself. I started thinking a bit about setting up a runtime state abstraction in Rosin. This will let me add a multiset bag, support one time lambda rules, and set up a better more explicit ordering for how rules are ingested and then applied.

My changes are still very preliminary, [I posted them up onto a separate branch](https://github.com/DataKinds/tree-rewriter/pull/2/files).
