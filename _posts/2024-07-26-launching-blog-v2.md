Hello all

as you can see, the blog looks different!

it used to look like this

![the old blog, stardrew valley themed](/assets/imgs/v2/image.png)

it was themed after stardew valley. it was cute and i liked it a lot. The reasons I decided to give it a visual overhaul are as follows:
* I didn't know where to put other pages without it looking bizarre, 
* I'd like to write more long form content _about_ video games and I felt like having my page themed after a single game is a lil biased, and
* I didn't feel like touching up the background lol

I had a few goals with this redesign
* Keep it quirky
* Keep it readable for old posts (including adding some extra goodies like syntax highlighting)
* Giving myself space to add more pages and do further experimentation

I suppose this also counts as part of my [100 blog posts challenge](/2022/06/17/100-blog-posts), but I'm no longer numbering the titles because that was annoying lol

so, with this redesign I've given myself a good foundation to keep hacking away on. hope you like it! new long form posts and possibly other goodies soon...
