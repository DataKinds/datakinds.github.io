Hey all. I've created a discord server to discuss programming language theory, a common topic on this blog. If you've enjoyed my musings about programming languages, or you just came from Google and you want to chat with a bunch of like-minded PL nerds, join our Discord here: <https://discord.gg/SJbHqWH>
