I like [@visakanv](https://twitter.com/visakanv)'s [do](https://twitter.com/visakanv/status/1330985556872818689) [100](https://twitter.com/visakanv/status/1362123101983576064) [thing](https://twitter.com/visakanv/status/1344327942055161856) [idea](http://www.visakanv.com/blog/100-2/). I haven't tried it, and if I'm being honest, the idea of committing to doing 100 of anything seems pretty intimidating. My ADHD is a powerful force. But I've been reworking my blog over the last couple days and I really want to do something with it. So I'm going to write 100 blog posts. 

I think I have a mental hold-up with the length of posts I put here. Like if I don't have enough to say, I should take it to Twitter instead of bothering to write something long-form here. Over these hundred posts, I'd like to quell that feeling. Whether that means smoothing out my workflow for writing or simply being okay writing shorter things on occasion, we'll see. 

These posts aren't going to be related to any topic in particular. I'll probably do some long-form technical content as is usual, but I'd be interested in doing other content as well. I've posted some [creative](/2020/07/01/forgetting) [work](/2019/10/15/a-logician-s-exceptional-nightmare) before so maybe I could do more stuff like that.

I will be tagging all of these posts "[100-blog-posts](/tags#100-blog-posts)", so you can browse through them all there. Because I'm not fucking around, this doesn't even count as the first post >:)
