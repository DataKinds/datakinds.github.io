title: Writing a rootkit, by someone who knows nothing about computer security

For some God awful reason, my most popular repo on Github is [syscall-rootkit](https://github.com/Aearnus/syscall-rootkit). It's a tiny Linux kernel module that intercepts syscalls to `read(2)` and `write(2)`. As of writing this blog post, it has 11 stars and 8 forks. Fingers crossed that those 8 people are using the code for good.

As far as how the program works, it's actually very simple. Once compiled, it can be hot loaded into the kernel as a kernel module (using `insmod`) and it replaces the pointers of `read(2)` and `write(2)` with pointers to its own `rk_read` and `rk_write` functions. [The code is short and sweet enough to fit on one page](https://github.com/Aearnus/syscall-rootkit/blob/master/rk.erb.c).

This simplicity didn't come easily. It came after struggling quite a while with some nasty gotcha's...

KASLR

(or, why this isn't actually a rootkit).

Typically, from the information I've gathered browsing Wikipedia and watching Youtube, a rootkit has a few very important properties:

1. It buries itself deep into the innards of a system.

2. It persists across boots and removal attempts.

3. It makes a reasonable attempt to hide itself from the end user.

4. It installs itself surreptitiously.

Now, uhm, let's look at which of these syscall-rootkit manages:

1. ‚úîÔ∏è It buries itself deep into the innards of a system.

2. ‚ùå It persists across boots and removal attempts.

3. ‚ùå It makes a reasonable attempt to hide itself from the end user.

4. ‚ùå It installs itself surreptitiously.

So, calling this project a rootkit in the first place is optimistic at best.

Points 3 and 4 are really only of concern for people who want to do harm, and I'm not really here to hurt anybody. So, throw those out the window and only focus on points 1 and 2. We've got point 1 down pat: I'm not sure any program could get lower and deeper than the kernel [without](https://hackaday.com/2017/12/11/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-intel-management-engine/) [getting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_Management_Engine#Security_vulnerabilities) [into](https://thehackernews.com/2018/02/airgap-computer-hacking.html) [any](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/10/meet-badbios-the-mysterious-mac-and-pc-malware-that-jumps-airgaps/) [funny business](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/08/11/memory_hole_roots_intel_processors/).

Last, but not least, we come to point 2. As a random guy and not a security researcher, the concept of a program trying to evade and block removal attempts is...

![How I feel](/assets/imgs/writing-a-rootkit/whoosh.png)

That leaves the final point to talk about. The first part of point 2 points out the fact that the rootkit must "persist across boots". This is an issue because of KASLR. **K**ernel **A**dress **S**pace **L**ayout **R**andomization a security measure implemented in the Linux kernel which ensures that every important bit of data and every table in the kernel's memory is placed at a random spot at every boot-up. This is to prevent idiots like me from overwriting the syscall table. KASLR is generally not a very large impediment to a black hat who's sufficiently dedicated to causing harm, with the Google search for "bypass Linux KASLR" returning 18,300 results

![bypass Linux KASLR](/assets/imgs/writing-a-rootkit/kaslr_linux.png)

and a Google search for "bypass Windows KASLR" revealing a writeup on a [longstanding Windows NT bug to bypass KASLR up until Windows 8.1](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/kaslr-bypass-mitigations-windows-81/).

Because of the fact that the point of my project wasn't to exploit KASLR (and out of laziness), I took a little bit of an easier approach to all of this. This approach, though, doesn't allow the "rootkit" to persist across boot-ups. Enter [make.rb](https://github.com/Aearnus/syscall-rootkit/blob/master/make.rb).

This hack of a script uses a templating engine to bake the address of the KASLR-hardened syscall table right into the code itself. To find this address, the script accesses a read-only file system exposed by the Linux kernel at `/boot/`. In `/boot/`, there exist `System.map` files which contain the absolute offsets of every single symbol in the kernel address space for that session (or possibly for that version of the kernel? I'm not too sure, actually).

![System.map](/assets/imgs/writing-a-rootkit/system_map.png)

_A screencap of the a bit of my System.map file, near the top._

It just so happens that the table that stores all the Linux system calls is also listed in the `System.map` file.

```ruby
linuxVersion = `uname -r`.chomp
puts "uname -r = #{linuxVersion}"
puts "using /boot/System.map-#{linuxVersion}"
syscallOffset = `sudo cat /boot/System.map-#{linuxVersion} | grep ' sys_call_table' | ruby -ane 'print $_.split(" ")[0]'```

This little block of Ruby code serves two purposes. The first purpose is to prove that anything can work with enough hacked together duct tape. The second purpose is to store the offset for the syscall table (labelled `sys_call_table`) in a variable `syscallOffset`. Once this variable is populated, it's placed in a string which is then templated to the top of the main C file for the rootkit.

```ruby
define = "#define SYS_CALL_TABLE ((unsigned long**)0x#{syscallOffset})"
```

`SYS_CALL_TABLE` is then used throughout the code to reference the table that holds the Linux system calls. Take that, KASLR!

On the next reboot and/or on the next update of the kernel, the address of that table will change and thus the rootkit will stop working (along with the rest of your computer, most likely).

The CR0 byte

Notice [this](https://github.com/Aearnus/syscall-rootkit/blob/master/rk.erb.c#L10)? These two lines gave me more headache than the rest of the code combined. Here's the kicker: without running these two macros, the entirety of the kernel module does _absolutely nothing_, with no indication that anything even went wrong. There's no compile time error, there's no segfault, and the CPU doesn't throw. Read on to find out why...

_Code from hell._

‚ùó‚ùó‚ùó‚ùó‚ùó‚ùó‚ùó‚ùó‚ùó‚ùó‚ùó‚ùó‚ùó‚ùó‚ùó‚ùó

BEFORE I BEGIN THIS SECTION: If you _ever_, and I mean **_ever_** see this in an actual kernel module, run screaming in the other direction. Run as far away as you possibly can. This is a massive security risk and the product of a programmer who has absolutely no idea what they are doing or the power that kernel level code wields. If you're going to scold me for writing this, I beg that you save your breath. _I already know_, and I've handled it as safe as I possibly could. Which, to be fair, isn't very safely.

‚ùó‚ùó‚ùó‚ùó‚ùó‚ùó‚ùó‚ùó‚ùó‚ùó‚ùó‚ùó‚ùó‚ùó‚ùó‚ùó

Anyway.

CR0 is a x86 specific **C**ontrol **R**egister used to control various properties of an x86 CPU. The `write_cr0` and `read_cr0` macros are defined in `asm/paravirt.h` and do exactly what they say on the tin: write to and read from the CR0 register. CR0 controls quite a few things about the CPU.

![Wikipedia CR0 table](/assets/imgs/writing-a-rootkit/cr0.png)

_From https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_register#CR0._

Those little macros above switch on and off bit 16 (`0x10000` is equivalent to `0b10000000000000000` -- everything turned off except the 16th bit). CR0's 16th bit is write protection. That macro disables ring 0 write protection, meaning everything that shouldn't ever change in kernel space suddenly becomes free game. It's taking every single modern security feature and chucking it straight back to the 60's, with all of its peeks, pokes, and unprotected memory. It's like waving a magnet over your RAM and expecting everything to be perfectly fine afterwards. So, I'm careful to only modify what I need before turning that write protection right back on.

Those modifications are right [here](https://github.com/Aearnus/syscall-rootkit/blob/master/rk.erb.c#L26). All I do is save the original `read(2)` and `write(2)` calls into their own respective `original_` functions (which really should be done before flipping the bit on CR0). Then, I replace those slots in the `SYS_CALL_TABLE` with my own function pointers and flip the bits on CR0 right back to how they should be. That's all there is to it. After doing that, I have full control over the system calls I overwrote -- and even more so, I have full control over any arbitrary kernel function (should I choose to modify it).


Final Words
---
If I had one takeaway from this whole process, it's that full control doesn't come easily. Building and installing this module requires superuser access for two separate commands, and for many Linux users, that's too important to take with a grain of salt. Figuring out a way to place that on a computer without them knowing would require a real feat of social engineering (or a real bad privilege escalation exploit). Even more so, kernel modules don't have access to the same set of C functions that userland applications do, so doing anything non-trivial is another feat of engineering in and of itself. All in all, this was a hell of a lot of fun to build, and a great learning experience. I'd just hope that those 8 people who forked `syscall-rootkit` aren't any more evil than I am üòÑ.
