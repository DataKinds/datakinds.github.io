I tried really hard to give Rust a fair chance. I wrote my fair share of applications with it, ranging from little toy programs to (a few unfinished attempts at) at full fledged applications. For a span of about a month, it was my de facto programming language.

After all that, truth be told: I prefer C. For _almost every_ situation that one might decide to use Rust, C(++) is the better choice.

For a programmer working alone, Rust's pitfalls far outweigh its benefits. (More on why I say "a programmer working alone" later...)

Rust gets in your way
===
The borrow checker is a pain in the ass. I know why it's designed this way, and I admire the Rust devs' goals with it. If you aren't familiar with it, the gist is that Rust has extremely strict compile-time enforced scoping rules where "ownership" of variables get passed around scopes, deinitializing the variable automatically once it reaches the end of the final scope. It's not just a good idea, it's a _great_ idea. In fact, I'd venture to say that it's one of the best ideas CS has seen in the past decade. C++ wishes it had an RAII system this good.

Just because it's good in theory, though, doesn't mean it's good in practice. A common point of contention with this system is **slices** (yuck!)

Skip this explanation if you already know what a slice is; but I need to explain it to be able to fully get across the absurdity that's coming up. A "slice" is, fundamentally, a special inner pointer into an array-like object. It allows for ownership to properly be transferred from the scope that the array was declared in to the scope that the slice is used, and it ensures that the array doesn't get deinitialized while the slice still exists.

I'll let the Rust docs do the rest of the talking. Take a second and read <https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.slice.html#method.split_at_mut>.

Ponder that for a moment. This is the _only_ way to access multiple areas of the same array at the same time -- even if the areas are completely independent. That's right: random access of an array using little slice windows is an idea that _fundamentally conflicts_ with Rust's idea of ownership. A single array object cannot have multiple pieces of code looking at arbitrary sections of it, even if those sections are guaranteed to be disjoint. Things such as [RwLock](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/struct.RwLock.html) can't even solve the problem of random slice access across threads. The programmer has to manually interface with the internals of whatever array object they're using (using `unsafe` mode) in order to provide a safe access interface.

This may sound like a niche issue, but I've run into this problem on _every single_ Rust program I've worked on. Sometimes, the solution is elegant, such as the DFT reconstruction algorithm I programmed [here](https://github.com/Aearnus/strange-probability-experiment/blob/master/src/main.rs#L150). Other times, though, this issue is a game changer. I've changed two whole projects over to C after dealing with this issue. The first project being something that dealt heavily with SDL2 audio, which uses pointers into structs and the like. The second project was a VM, where I wanted to have a thread constantly watching a slice of memory and interpret it as VRAM. This was the response I received to asking about that in a Rust discord server:

![As if incompatibility was the worst of my problems...](/assets/imgs/rust-is-not-the-right-choice/0.png)

All of this makes complete sense in theory. Borrowing semantics get super complicated (undecidable?) when you have tons of code paths looking at arbitrary pieces of memory. In practice, though, it only gets in the programmer's way. While it's a useful safety net to know for a fact when an array goes out of scope, it's not worth losing the utility of internal pointers (among many other things).

Rust has complexity creep
===
Rust is, by far, not a bloated language. The [standard library is small, modular, nicely documented, and easily browsable](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/). The creep comes in when you look at how the language itself operates. The borrow checker, most of all, is a black box in the most literal sense of the word. It is nearly impossible for a Rust beginner to fully understand the implementation details of the borrow checker, and they get bit in the ass constantly because of it.

I don't think I need to write any more of this section after I link this blog post: <https://manishearth.github.io/blog/2015/05/27/wrapper-types-in-rust-choosing-your-guarantees/>. Or, maybe, this ["cheat sheet"](https://i.redd.it/moxxoeir7iqz.png) will explain it all?

There are tens of ways to get a reference to an object, all with slightly different semantics and slightly different behavior. This is _awful_, and it's a huge turn off for anyone who's just learning their `&`'s and their `&mut`'s.

If the borrow checker and the reference situation wasn't enough for you, consider the many gotcha's in Rust's type system. There are features that many functional programmers will have become accustomed to, such as Higher Kinded Types. This is required in order to introduce the "type class", the idea that you can group a bunch of types together where all the types implement a common interface. An example of this is the ubiquitous Monad -- a type class that says "this type supports being wrapped in a context and being composed with other functions that support this type" (If this peaked your curiosity, I recommend [this awesome blog post by Adit](http://adit.io/posts/2013-04-17-functors,_applicatives,_and_monads_in_pictures.html), which explains it all with drawings in Haskell terms). Rust, notably, [does not support true higher kinded types](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues/324).

"But Tyler", you may ask. "Wouldn't adding higher kinded types simply make the language more complex?" The answer is both yes and no. From an implementation standpoint, adding higher kinded types would make the language much more complex. From a user's standpoint, though, adding higher kinded types cut down on the inconsistency and the subtle complexity of using the language in a huge way. Believe it or not, Rust already has a ton of half-assed monads in its standard library. Consider the [`std::option`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/option/) type (equivalent to Haskell's [`Maybe`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.11.1.0/docs/Data-Maybe.html)). It implements a monadic interface through the [`and_then`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/option/enum.Option.html#method.and_then) function (monadic bind) and the [`Some`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/option/enum.Option.html#variant.Some) variant (monadic return). This is all fine and dandy until you run into a function like [`flat_map`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/iter/trait.Iterator.html#method.flat_map) (which is what monadic binding is called in most other languages) or you run into a crate that doesn't call monadic binding `flat_map` or `and_then`. Or, even worse, those terms might be misused and overloaded. The Rust core team has been very good about keeping this consistent, but it's unreasonable to expect the same level of consistency from the Rust community -- and that could be a major point of confusion for people learning Rust's conventions. Type classes, on the other hand, can be largely ignored by the programmer unless they are needed. And, in the case that they are, it will be good to know that `and_then` (or `return`, or `flat_map`, or whatever the core devs would call it) will _always_ do the right thing.

Not everyone is a computer scientist, Rust, and even if your community is a shining beacon of what it means to be newcomer friendly, your language sure as hell isn't.


So, what's good about Rust?
===
Rust makes the process of collaborating on a complex piece of software a breeze. Its strong compile time guarantees mean that in 99 cases out of 100, "if it compiles, it ships". You don't have to worry about others' code breaking and you don't have to worry about undefined behavior (eugh) or vague types in functions you didn't write. The language trades out friction between people and replaces it with friction between the user and the screen. It is a complex language so your programs don't have to be. In that way, it's a bit magical -- when you're working in a team. Alone, though, these benefits don't apply (or at least nowhere near in the capacity that they do while working with others).

From another perspective, Rust takes the complexity out of the written program and moves it into the language. [This comment from one of the Rust core devs honestly prompted me to rethink my opinion on a lot of the things I wrote in this post](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17627642). Here's a picture if the comment ever gets removed:

What should solo developers use instead?
===
I don't care, unless I'm using your software.

If you're making public facing software, though, a strong type system will _always_ make your code easier to reason about and easier to know that nothing Badâ„¢ is happening. Depending on the project, maybe Rust will be the right tool. But it's way more likely that C/C++ will be the right tool (I'll nerd out about C++20 in some other blog post). It's also worth to consider that maybe the right tool could be something like [Pony](https://www.ponylang.org/), [ATS](http://www.ats-lang.org/), [Crystal](https://crystal-lang.org/), [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/), or [Nim](https://nim-lang.org/) (slight bias towards the last two :P). Maybe the right tool isn't a language in this ol' statically compiled realm at all. Or maybe you're a JavaScript shill. To each their own.

It's more important to use the right tool for the job than it is to be personally attached -- and hell; if C is the right tool, there is no reason to shove Rust where it doesn't belong.
