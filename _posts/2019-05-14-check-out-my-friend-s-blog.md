Hey all -- sorry for the RSS spam, but this is worth it. My [friend Amelia started a blog](https://synthrose.github.io/ "SynthRose's blog"), and you all should check it out and follow it. She's the smartest person I know and this is definitely putting her soon-to-be physics degree to good use. Check out her first post [here](https://synthrose.github.io/2019/05/14/music-theory-pt-0.html "Music Theory part 0").
