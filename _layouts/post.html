      Hey all. I will keep this incredibly brief: if you don’t support trans rights, the Black Lives Matter movement and any number of its subgroups, or if you think everything that’s been happening doesn’t apply to you: please close this window and re-evaluate your priorities. This is not unnecessarily political:
      everything we do as developers and engineers is inherently political. We control the modern digital world, and doing
      so without regard for the minority groups we may affect is dangerous and utterly reprehensible. A great link that’s
      been going around with ways you can get involved is here: <a
        href="https://blacklivesmatters.carrd.co/">https://blacklivesmatters.carrd.co/</a>. If you’d like to educate
      yourself on the issues that are currently at hand, a book I’ve had highly recommended to me is <a
        href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6792458-the-new-jim-crow">The New Jim Crow by Michelle Alexander</a>.
      Another piece that’s more relevant than ever is the late Martin Luther King Jr.’s <a
        href="https://www.africa.upenn.edu/Articles_Gen/Letter_Birmingham.html">Letter from a Birmingham
        Jail</a>.
