    Also, I run a discord server called <a class="page-link" href="https://discord.gg/SJbHqWH">PLT & More</a>. It's programming language centric, with spaces to talk math and other nerdy topics. Join if you'd like to hang out and talk about the impending collapse of the global supply chain. And programming languages. Or conlanging? We've got it all.
